# Selenium Test Automation Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Selenium-based automation framework to interact with a web application, simulate user actions, and validate results. The project is built using **.NET Core** and leverages **Selenium WebDriver** to automate the browser.

### Two Approaches
There are two main approaches in this project:

Without ```bash testScript.json:``` Found in the master branch (```git "main try catch" commit```). This approach uses hardcoded steps and manually triggers commands.

With ```bash testScript.json:``` Found in the ```git "new version with json script" branch.``` This approach dynamically loads commands from a JSON file, making it easier to extend and modify test steps.

**Note:** While it's usually a better practice to split different approaches into separate branches, due to project constraints, both approaches are available in different commits.

## Implemented Steps

Below is a breakdown of the commands implemented and their purpose:

## Host and Service Configuration with Dependency Injection and Logging

### HostBuilderSetup
The project uses **Dependency Injection (DI)** and **Logging** in the ```csharp HostSetup class```. This setup is done using the ```csharp Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()``` method, where we configure services, logging, and other dependencies.

Hereâ€™s a brief summary of how services are configured:

**Configuration Services:**
- appsettings.json is loaded to retrieve configuration settings.
- Services for each command (OpenUrlCommand, RemoveAdsCommand, etc.) are registered.

**Logging:**
- Console logging is configured with Information level logs.
- Logs for each command are captured through the ILogger interface injected into the commands.

**Service Registration:**
- Command Factory is registered to dynamically create command instances.
- Commands such as OpenUrlCommand, ClickAddNewRecordButtonCommand, etc., are registered as singleton services.

## Running the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run ```bash dotnet restore``` to restore the NuGet packages.
Run ```bashdotnet build``` to build the project.
Execute the project using ```bash dotnet run``` to run the automation script.
